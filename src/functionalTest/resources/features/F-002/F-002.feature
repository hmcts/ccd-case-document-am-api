    Given an appropriate test context as detailed in the test data source

    @S-020
    Scenario: must successfully receive a document's binary content
      Given a user with [an active caseworker profile in CCD with full permissions on a document field]
      And a successful call [by another privileged user to upload a document with mandatory metadata] as in [Default_Document_Upload_Data]
      When a request is prepared with appropriate values
      And it is submitted to call the [Get Binary Content by Document ID] operation of [CCD Case Document AM API]

      When a request is prepared with appropriate values
      And the request [contains a non existing document id]
      And it is submitted to call the [Get Binary Content by Document ID] operation of [CCD Case Document AM API]
      Then a negative response is received
      And the response has all other details as expected

    @S-022 @Ignore #will test this scenario after AM-450 implementation
