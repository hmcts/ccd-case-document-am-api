Feature: F-005: Patch Document with ttl

  Background: Load test data for the scenario
    Given an appropriate test context as detailed in the test data source

#  @S-051
#  Scenario: must successfully Patch Document with ttl
#    Given a user with [an active caseworker profile in CCD with limited permissions on a document field]
#    And   a successful call [by another privileged user to upload a document with mandatory metadata] as in [Default_Document_Upload]
#    When  a request is prepared with appropriate values
#    And   the request [contains document id uploaded above with ttl]
#    And   it is submitted to call the [Patch Document with ttl] operation of [CCD Case Document AM API]
#    Then  a positive response is received
#    And   the response [contains the same ttl and document ID uploaded above]
#    And   the response has all other details as expected
#
#  @S-052
#  Scenario: must get an error response for a non-existing ttl
#    Given a user with [an active caseworker profile in CCD with full permissions on a document field]
#    When  a request is prepared with appropriate values
#    And   the request [contains a non-existing ttl]
#    And   it is submitted to call the [Patch Document with ttl] operation of [CCD Case Document AM API]
#    Then  a negative response is received
#    And   the response has all the details as expected
#
#  @S-053
#  Scenario: must get an error response for a malformed ttl
#    Given a user with [an active caseworker profile in CCD with full permissions on a document field]
#    When  a request is prepared with appropriate values
#    And   the request [contains a malformed ttl]
#    And   it is submitted to call the [Patch Document with ttl] operation of [CCD Case Document AM API]
#    Then  a negative response is received
#    And   the response has all the details as expected
#
#  @S-054 @Ignore #this test has to be done manually
#  Scenario: must get an error response for patch document with ttl for unprivileged user
#    Given a user with [an active caseworker profile in CCD with unprivileged user (i.e. just Create permission) on a document field]
#    And   a successful call [by another privileged user to upload a document with mandatory metadata] as in [Default_Document_Upload]
#    When  a request is prepared with appropriate values
#    And   the request [contains unprivileged user and a document id uploaded above with ttl]
#    And   it is submitted to call the [Patch Document with ttl] operation of [CCD Case Document AM API]
#    Then  a negative response is received
#    And   the response has all other details as expected
#
#  @S-055 @Ignore #this test has to be done manually
#  Scenario: must get an error response for patch document with ttl for unprivileged user
#    Given a user with [an active caseworker profile in CCD with unprivileged user (i.e. just Read permission) on a document field]
#    And   a successful call [by another privileged user to upload a document with mandatory metadata] as in [Default_Document_Upload]
#    When  a request is prepared with appropriate values
#    And   the request [contains unprivileged user and a document id uploaded above with ttl]
#    And   it is submitted to call the [Patch Document with ttl] operation of [CCD Case Document AM API]
#    Then  a negative response is received
#    And   the response has all other details as expected

#  @S-056 @Ignore #this test has to be done manually
#  Scenario: must get an error response for patch document with ttl for unprivileged user
#    Given a user with [an active caseworker profile in CCD with unprivileged user (i.e. just Update permission) on a document field]
#    And   a successful call [by another privileged user to upload a document with mandatory metadata] as in [Default_Document_Upload]
#    When  a request is prepared with appropriate values
#    And   the request [contains unprivileged user and a document id uploaded above with ttl]
#    And   it is submitted to call the [Patch Document with ttl] operation of [CCD Case Document AM API]
