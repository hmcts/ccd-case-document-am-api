  Scenario: [SAMPLE] must retrieve case document metadata successfully
    Given a user with [an active caseworker profile in CCD with full permissions on a document field]
    #And a successful call [by another privileged user to upload a document with mandatory metadata] as in [Default_Document_Upload_Data]
#    When a request is prepared with appropriate values
#    And the request [uses a uid that exists in IDAM]
#    And it is submitted to call the [Get Document Metadata by Document ID] operation of [CCD Case Document AM API]
#    Then a positive response is received
#    And the response has all the details as expected
